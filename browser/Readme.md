# How to Build a Simple Web Browser Using Rust and GTK

This repo contains the WIP code for a simple web browser.  The intent is to show how some of the basics of a web browser works as well as introduce Graphical User Interface programming with Rust.  

## Defining a Simple Web Browser

In its most basic form, a web browser fetches an HTML document and then converts that HTML to a graphical representation.  To start, this tutorial will only focus on text as text is one of the most important aspects of a web browser.
